        <h2>USC Math Directed Reading Program (Jan 2024 – May 2024)</h2>
        <p>During my last semester, I was accepted into the directed reading program, where we self-study a specialized math topic. I was joined with a peer and a PhD student to mentor us, and we studied differential geometry and gave a presentation on minimal surfaces. You can find the presentation and some code for plots <a href="https://github.com/anthonywinney/Minimal-Surfaces-Presentation-Code">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Backend Developer – Green Capital Connect (Aug 2023 – Dec 2023)</h2>
        <p>This was my senior year capstone project. A group of us computer science students worked on a startup for an interested party. The goal was to connect sustainability-conscious investors and clients. You can find a short presentation on the project <a href="https://github.com/anthonywinney/Green-Capital-Connect">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Talk2Trojans (Aug 2023 – Dec 2023)</h2>
        <p>The goal of this app was to get a feel for Android app development in Java and maintaining data in Google Firebase. It supports connectivity, so updates made on one device will update for others. See some screenshots below and a link to the code <a href="https://github.com/anthonywinney/Talk2Trojans">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>AI Puzzle Generator (Aug 2021 – Dec 2021)</h2>
        <p>This was my first AI project, where I implemented a simple AI algorithm using hill-climbing and simulated annealing (ie. finding the maximum by strategically stepping). You can find the code and an explanation of the puzzle <a href="https://github.com/anthonywinney/AI-Puzzle-Generator">here</a>.</p>
