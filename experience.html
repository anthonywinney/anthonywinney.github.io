        <h2>USC Course Producer – CSCI 356 (Jan 2023 – May 2024)</h2>
        <p>CSCI 356: Introduction to Computer Systems deals with low-level programming, like assembly and C, and covers things like hacking, caching, and virtual memory. I earned an A in the course and worked ~8-hour weeks as a course producer for the next three semesters, where I held office hours and made sure to stay quick with the lecture material and homework. I also took initiative to create learning guides for each of the five assignments, and you can find PDFs of those guides here. I was happy to find out they were reused for Fall 2025! I really enjoyed the material, it was super technical and logical. And I really, really(x10) enjoyed working with the students and Dr. Paolieri.</p>

        <h2>USC CS@SC Computer Science Teacher (May 2022 – Aug 2022)</h2>
        <p>I was a teacher at a USC summer program CS@SC for eight 40-hour weeks, and I rotated through topics including Python, HTML/CSS, and robotics. Ages ranged 5–18, and I taught the whole range. USC gives scholarships to most students, too, as it’s targeted toward girls and low-income students. It’s a great program, you can find their home page <a href="https://summercamp.usc.edu/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>ASU (AM)^2 REU (May 2018 – Aug 2018, May 2019 – Aug 2019)</h2>
        <p>I was a researcher for two summers at ASU’s Applied Math REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates). Each time, I was paired with a few other students and we were mentored by Dr. Platte. In both summers, the topics studied fell under the broad umbrella of approximation theory. Please go to my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/anthonywinney/ASU-MATH-REU-Interpolation-Code">here</a> to find pictures, MATLAB code, and short descriptions of the projects. See below for work that was submitted to the NSF (National Science Foundation) or presented to the rest of the cohort.</p>
