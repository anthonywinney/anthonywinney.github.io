        <h1>Education</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I went to Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, AZ and graduated top 5% of my class with straight A’s 
            my junior and senior years. 34 ACT. 10 AP exams: six scores of 5, three scores of 4, one score of 3.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>I also took courses at ASU while I was in high school:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    MAT 300: Mathematical Structures — introductory proofs class with some discrete math. 
                    I was the <strong>only student to earn an A+</strong> in this class. Click 
                    <a href="#">here</a> to see a 10-page tiling-proofs project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    MAT 342: Linear Algebra — earned an A.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            
            <li>I was admitted into USC as a Presidential Scholar (~1% of applicants — half-tuition academic scholarship).</li>
            <br>

            <li>I earned A’s (not A-) in 4/7 of my math classes at USC.</li>
            <br>

            <li>While most of my work is on the other pages, I’d like to showcase a montage of the games I built in 
            my Video Game Programming class. Everything was written in C++ and rendered in SDL. It was an awesome 
            class and taught me how to build video games from scratch.</li>
                <ul><li>[Game montage coming soon]</li></ul>
            <br>

            <li>I graduated from USC with a <strong>3.46</strong> GPA and a Bachelor’s of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor’s of Science 
            in Computer Science in May 2024. Note that at USC, computer science is in the engineering school so I have 
            both a liberal arts and engineering degree. I’m very happy and thankful for my education. It’s the best of both worlds!</li>
