        <p>
            I went to Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, AZ and graduated top 5% of my class with straight A’s 
            my junior and senior years. 34 ACT. 10 AP exams: six scores of 5, three scores of 4, one score of 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also took courses at ASU while I was in high school:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>MAT 300: Mathematical Structures</strong> — introductory proofs class with some discrete math. 
                I was the only student to earn an A+ in this class. Click 
                <a href="#">here</a> to see a 10-page tiling-proofs project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>MAT 342: Linear Algebra</strong> — earned an A.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I was admitted into USC as a Presidential Scholar (~1% of applicants — half-tuition academic scholarship).
        </p>
        <p>
            I earned A’s (not A-) in 4/7 of my math classes at USC.

            While most of my work is on the other pages, I’d like to showcase a montage of the games I built in 
            my Video Game Programming class. Everything was written in C++ and rendered in SDL. It was an awesome 
            class and taught me how to build video games from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            [Game montage coming soon]
        </p>

            I graduated from USC with a 3.46 GPA and a Bachelor’s of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor’s of Science 
            in Computer Science in May 2024. Note that at USC, computer science is in the engineering school so I have 
            both a liberal arts and engineering degree. I’m very happy and thankful for my education. It’s the best of both worlds!
