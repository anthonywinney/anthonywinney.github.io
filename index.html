        <p><span class="code-font">Hello World!</span> I’m a recent <strong>USC</strong> graduate with bachelor’s degrees in <strong>Mathematics</strong> and <strong>Computer Science</strong>. I’ve been lucky to work construction jobs in Los Angeles with my cousin Mikey, who is a personal contractor, since my graduation in <strong>May 2024</strong>. It’s been nice to take a break to work with my hands and learn some practical skills.</p>
        <p>Now, I’m excited to start my STEM career, <strong>looking for work</strong> either as an <strong>aspiring actuary</strong> or <strong>backend software engineer</strong>. I’ve always been keen on math, in fact it’s still a dream to get a math PhD and teach/research sometime in the future. But I am focused on developing skills applicable for the current tech landscape, and I’d be grateful for whoever gives me a chance to work hard and gain some industry experience.</p>

        <h2>Recent endeavors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Society of Actuaries Exams:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Exam FM (Financial Mathematics) <span style="color: orange;">(scheduled)</span> for 2/15/25</li>
                <li>Exam P (Probability)<span style="color: green;">(passed)</span> 11/18/24</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm working through <em>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</em> by Aurélien Géron. It’s a very practical book and I’ll have examples of my own code up here very soon. I plan to have a dedicated <a href="sports.html">sports page</a> for it, where I build out a sports prediction algorithm with the techniques I learn in this book.</p>

        <p>I try to stay sharp. Recently finished (+ notes) <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> by Nietzsche, ¾ of the way through <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> by Rand, and just starting <em>Being and Nothingness</em> by Sartre. I also plan to continue to “take classes this semester” (ie. self-study) by following along with the semester’s schedule. Will update with work as Spring 2025 progresses.</p>    </div>
